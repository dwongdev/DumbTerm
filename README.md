# DumbTerm

A stupidly simple web-based terminal emulator, with common tools and Starship enabled! 🚀

![dumbterm-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a4542f-7f69-4dcd-a6df-39e5231e3db2)

- Access your terminal from any device with a web browser
- Execute commands just like in a native terminal
- Starship prompt provides a beautiful terminal experience with git status, command duration, etc.
- PIN protection (recommended) prevents unauthorized access
- Use the data directory to persist files between container restarts
- Demo mode available for testing and demonstrations - simulated terminal (set DEMO_MODE=true)

## Use cases:
* Build with docker: To create a sandboxed environment for testing scripts, code, applications, emulate a VPS, showcase examples and more. All without having to install dependencies on your local machine!
* Build locally: To access your client's cli/terminal through your browser instead!
* Self-hosting: Put behind a reverse proxy, auth provider (like authentik, authelia, etc), Cloudflare tunnels with application access rules, etc for secure external access.
* Another alternative to web terminals such as ttyd, shellinabox, etc

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Docker (recommended)
* Node.js >=20.0.0 (for local development)
  * _Windows-specific_: [WSL or Node.js v16 - Option 3: Running Locally](#option-3-running-locally-for-developers)

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies)

* Docker method uses a pre-installed Debian Bullseye-based container/environment.

```bash
# Pull and run with one command
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./data:/root/data \
  -v ./config:/root/.config \ 
  -e DUMBTERM_PIN=1234 \
  -e SITE_TITLE=DumbTerm \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e ENABLE_STARSHIP=true \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  -e LOCKOUT_TIME=15 \
  -e MAX_SESSION_AGE=24 \
  dumbwareio/dumbterm:latest
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Enter your PIN if configured
3. Enjoy your web-based terminal!

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing) - Recommended

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file or use the provided one:

```yaml
services:
  dumbterm:
    image: dumbwareio/dumbterm:latest
    container_name: dumbterm
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - ${DUMBTERM_PORT:-3000}:3000
    volumes:
      - ${DUMBTERM_CONFIG:-./config}:/root/.config
      - ${DUMBTERM_DATA_DIR:-./data}:/root/data
    environment:
      # Container timezone
      TZ: ${DUMBTERM_TZ:-America/Los_Angeles}
      # The title shown in the web interface
      SITE_TITLE: ${DUMBTERM_SITE_TITLE:-DumbTerm}
      # Recommended PIN protection (leave empty to disable)
      DUMBTERM_PIN: ${DUMBTERM_PIN:-1234}
      # The base URL for the application
      BASE_URL: ${DUMBTERM_BASE_URL:-http://localhost:3000}
      ENABLE_STARSHIP: ${ENABLE_STARSHIP:-true}
      LOCKOUT_TIME: ${DUMBTERM_LOCKOUT_TIME:-15} # Minutes
      # Session duration in hours before requiring re-authentication
      MAX_SESSION_AGE: ${DUMBTERM_MAX_SESSION_AGE:-24} # Hours
      # (OPTIONAL) - List of allowed origins for CORS
      # ALLOWED_ORIGINS: ${DUMBTERM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:-http://localhost:3000}
```

Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Running Locally (For Developers)

* Local method will use your local terminal environment (Windows: Powershell, Mac / Linux: bash).

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

> [!TIP]
> #### Windows specific: 
> - If you encounter issues with `node-pty` you can try using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or may need to install:
> - `Node.js v16` (Look into [nvm for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for multi node version support):
>   - `winget install CoreyButler.NVMforWindows`
>   - with nvm installed use: `nvm install 16 && nvm use 16`
> - `windows-build-tools` through Visual Studio Installer `MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ {arch} Build Tools`
>   - Contact us or View the [official Microsoft documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty?tab=readme-ov-file#windows) for more details

2. `cp .env.example .env` > Set environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
PORT=3000                  # Port to run the server on
DUMBTERM_PIN=1234          # Optional PIN protection
SITE_TITLE=DumbTerm        # Custom site title
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Base URL for the application
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Starship usage
* Starship is a cross-shell prompt that provides a beautiful terminal experience.
* It is enabled by default in the Docker image and is the recommended method.
* To disable it, set `ENABLE_STARSHIP` to `false` in your environment variables.
* You can customize the Starship prompt by using one of the following steps:

### 1. Use a preset configuration from starship.

#### Starship Presets:

> [!TIP]
> copy and paste one of the starship preset commands below into DumbTerm and that's it!
<details>
<summary><b>Example Preset Command:</b></summary>

![preset-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/affdd780-5471-40de-adfd-9242feeec9da)
</details>

<br/>

> [!WARNING]
>  **Note:** If running locally or mapped volume to your actual `starship.toml` config, the preset commands will overwrite your existing `starship.toml` file. Make sure to back it up as needed.

</details>

- You can also view the available presets by running `starship preset -l` in DumbTerm.

For more details, visit the [Starship Presets page](https://starship.rs/presets/).

### 2. Modify the `~/.config/starship.toml` file in your set volume mount or within the container.  
  - The default configuration is located in `/root/.config/starship.toml`.
  - You can also mount a custom `starship.toml` file to the container using Docker volumes.
  - Update or add your custom configurations to starship.toml.
    - Visit [Starship Configuration](https://starship.rs/config/) for more information on customizing the prompt.

### 3. Running locally
- If you are running DumbTerm locally, DumbTerm will inherit your current styles.
  - Meaning if you already have starship enabled locally, you should be able to see your current styles accordingly.
- You must install Starship on your local machine if you wish to use DumbTerm with starship _locally_.
  - To install Starship, follow the instructions on the [Starship installation page](https://starship.rs/installing/).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

DumbTerm provides a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts for efficient terminal management. The modifier keys vary by operating system:
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Alt+{key}`
- macOS: `Ctrl+Cmd+{key}`

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| New Terminal | `Ctrl+Alt+T` | `Ctrl+Cmd+T` |
| Close Terminal | `Ctrl+Alt+W` | `Ctrl+Cmd+W` |
| Rename Terminal | `Ctrl+Alt+R` | `Ctrl+Cmd+R` |
| Search in Terminal | `Ctrl+F` | `Cmd+F` |
| Next Terminal | `Ctrl+Alt+>` or `Ctrl+Alt+.` | `Ctrl+Cmd+>` or `Ctrl+Cmd+.` |
| Previous Terminal | `Ctrl+Alt+<` or `Ctrl+Alt+,` | `Ctrl+Cmd+<` or `Ctrl+Cmd+,` |
| Switch to Terminal 1-9 | `Ctrl+Alt+[1-9]` | `Ctrl+Cmd+[1-9]` |

### Terminal Search
- Press `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F` (macOS) to open the search bar
- Use Up/Down arrow buttons or Enter/Shift+Enter to cycle through matches
- Press Escape or the close button to exit search mode

### Tab Management
- **Drag and Drop**: Click and drag tabs to reorder them
- **Rename**: Double-click a tab or use the keyboard shortcut to rename it
- **History**: Terminal content is automatically preserved across browser refreshes and restarts
- **Direct Selection**: Use number shortcuts (1-9) to quickly switch between the first 9 terminals

## Security

>  It is highly recommended to set a strong PIN, use HTTPS, use ALLOWED_ORIGINS, and integrate with an auth provider (i.e. Authentik / Authelia / tinyauth, etc).

We're dumb, but not stupid. Use a full-featured auth provider for production use.

* https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik (More difficult to set up, but production ready)
* https://github.com/authelia/authelia
* https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth (Easy with docker compose integration)

### Features

* Variable-length PIN support (numeric)
* Constant-time PIN comparison
* Brute force protection:
  * 5 attempts maximum
  * 15-minute lockout after failed attempts
  * IP-based tracking
* Secure cookie handling
* Session-based authentication
* CORS support for origin restrictions (optional)
* HTTPS support (when configured with proper BASE_URL)

## Technical Details

### Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js (>=20.0.0) with Express
* **Frontend**: XTerm.js for terminal emulation
* **Container**: Docker with Debian Bullseye base
* **Terminal**: node-pty for process spawning
* **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time terminal I/O
* **Security**: cors for cross-origin requests
<!-- * **Security**: Helmet for HTTP security headers -->

### Dependencies

* express: Web framework
* node-pty: Terminal process spawning
